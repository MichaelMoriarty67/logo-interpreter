# Basic Logo (LISP) Interpreter

⚠️ **this project is still under development** ⚠️

This is a project I've built after reading "The Structures & Interpretation of Computer Programs".

The 3rd chapter of this book goes into detail on the architecture of interperters and outlines a rough spec of an interpreter for the Logo dialect of LISP.

This is my *interpretation* (😉) of that rough spec.
